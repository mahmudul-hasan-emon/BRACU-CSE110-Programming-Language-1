Task 1
======
Write python program, which prints the following sequences of values in loops:

a) 24, 18, 12, 6, 0, -6
b) -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20
c) 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63
d) 18,-27, 36,-45,54,-63

=====================================================================

Hints(1): Use a while loop for solving these problems.

Hints(2): We are already familiar with the print() function. But when we use it to print any value it automatically adds an additional newline after each print statement.

For example:
print(1)
print(2)

Output:
1
2

=====================================================================

To solve this problem, in Python3, we need to add an extra argument (end = " ") in the print function which tells the program to skip printing the additional newline.

For example:
print(1, end =" ")
print(2)

Output:(prints the next output right to the previous one)
12

=====================================================================

In Task-1(a), the loop counter should be initialized at 24 and the loop should terminate when the loop counter reaches -6. The difference between the first two values is 24-18=6. So the loop counter value is getting decremented by 6 in every iteration.

For your understanding task 1(a) code is done for you.

# a) 24, 18, 12, 6, 0, -6
=========================
​
# initialize loop counter
counter = 24
​
# loop structure
while counter >= -6:
    
    #inside loop body
    if counter == -6:
        print(counter, end = "") 
    else:
        print(counter, end = ", ") 
     
    counter = counter - 6 #updating loop counter
    #inside loop body
    
#outside loop body
24, 18, 12, 6, 0, -6

=============================

# b)-10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20
=============================
​
count =-10
while(count<=20):
    if(count==20):
        print(count, end = "")
    else:
        print(count, end = ", ")
    count =count+5
-10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20

==========================

# c)18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63
==========================
​
count =18
while(count<=63):
    if(count==63):
        print(count,"")
    else:
        print(count, end=", ")
    count =count+9
18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63 

======================

Hints for 1(d):

print(5 * (-1)) gives output -5
print("-" + str(5)) gives output -5

# d)18,-27, 36,-45,54,-63
=========================
​
pos =1
counter =18
while(pos<=6):
    if(pos%2==0):
        if(counter==63):
            print(counter*(-1), end ="")
        else:
            print(counter*(-1), end =", ")
    else:
        print(counter, end =",")
    
    counter =counter+9
    pos =pos+1
18,-27, 36,-45, 54,-63
====================================================================
All the tasks can be solved using both the "while loop" and the "for loop". But you need to choose the best looping construct which is the most suitable for solving a particular task.

Task 11
=======
Write a Python program which takes a number and prints the digits from the unit place, then the tenth, then hundredth, etc. (Right to Left)

[Consider the input number to be an INTEGER. You are not allowed to use String indexing for solving this task]

Example: If the user gives 32768, then print 8, 6, 7, 2, 3

=========================================================================

Hint (1): The input() function, converts the input data to String data type by default. Use this knowledge to solve this problem.

Hint (2): First to get the digit from the right side, take the remainder of the number using modulus (%) operator and print the digit. For dropping the last digit, perform floor division by 10 on the number. Then start over.

32,768 % 10 = 8

32,768 // 10 = 3, 276

3, 276 % 10 = 6

3, 276 // 10 = 327

327 % 10 = 7

327 // 10 = 32

32 % 10 = 2

32 //10 = 3

3 % 10 = 3

3 // 10 = 0

Done! When the number becomes 0 your loop should end.

#Todo

number =int(input("Please enter a number: "))
while(number!=0):
    result =number%10
    if(result==number):

=============

Task 12
=======
Write a Python program that takes a number and tells how many digits are in that number.
[Consider the input number to be an INTEGER.]

You are not allowed to use len() function

Example: If the user gives 9876, you should print 4.

Hint: Keep floor dividing by ten and count how many times this could be divided.

9876 floor divide by 10, is 987, count that got 1 digit (total 1)
987 floor divide by 10, is 98, count that got 1 digit (total 2)
98 floor divide by 10, is 9, count that got 1 digit (total 3)
9 floor divide by 10, is 0, count that got 1 digit (total 4)

Done! (When the number becomes 0 your loop should end.)

#Todo
​
number =int(input("Please enter the number:"))
count=0
while(number>0):
    count=count+1
    number=number//10
print(count)
Please enter the number:9876

Task 13
=======
Write a Python program that takes a number from the user and prints its digits from left to right. (left to right)

[Consider the input number to be an INTEGER. You are not allowed to use String indexing for solving this task]

=========================================================================

Example: if the user gives 32768, then print 3, 2, 7, 6, 8

=========================================================================

Hint(1): The input() function, converts the input data to String data type by default. Use this knowledge to solve this problem.

Hint(2):

Step1: count how many digits
Step2: calculate 10 to the power that (number of digits) minus 1.

Step3: Say, 32768 has 5 digits, so you calculate 10 to the power 4 which is 10,000. Then divide 32,768 by 10,000 and thus you get 3.
Take remainder of 32,768 by 10,000 and thus you get 2,768 Then divide 10,000 by 10 to get 1,000
Then divide 2,768 by 1,000 and thus you get 2.
take remainder of 2,768 by 1,000 and thus you get 768 keep going on until there is no more digits left (zero!).

In short:
Loop 1: First count digits, say 5 in this case for 32,768
Loop 2: Then calculate 10 to the power 4 (5-1), that is 10,000.
Loop 3: Then repeat following three steps
32,768 // 10,000 = 3
32,768 % 10,000 = 2,768
10,000//10 = 1,000

2,768 // 1,000 = 2
2,768 % 1,000 = 768
1,000//10 = 100

768 // 100 = 7
768 % 100 = 68
100//10= 10

68 //10 = 6
68 % 10 = 8
10//10= 1

8 //1 = 8
8 % 1 = 0
1//10=0

Task 15
=======
Write a Python program that takes a number and tells if it is a perfect number or not. [The input number has to be an INTEGER]

Perfect Number: An integer number is said to be a perfect number if its factors, including 1 but not the number itself, sum to the number.

==========================================================

Example01:

Input:
6

Output:
6 is a perfect number

Explanation:
6 have 4 divisors: 1, 2, 3, and 6.
If we add all factors except itself, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.

Example03:

Input:
33

Output:
33 is not a perfect number

Explanation:
33 have 3 divisors: 1, 3, 11, and 33.

Write a Python program that asks the user for one number and tells if it is a prime number or not. [The input number has to be an INTEGER]

Prime Number: If a number has only two divisors, (1 and itself), then it is prime. If it is divisible by more numbers, then it is not a prime.

==========================================================

Hint: use the divisor count from task 16.
